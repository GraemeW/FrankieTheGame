# Assets:  Game - Speech

Frankie makes use of a custom dialogue system, and its dialogue trees are stored as scriptable objects in the sub-folders of this [Dialogue directory](./).

Briefly, an AI Conversant, such as the standard [Conversant Component](./ConversantComponent.prefab) prefab that is childed to every [Character Object](../CharacterObjects/), is used to load a [Dialogue](./) scriptable object, which contains nodes that are traversed via the [DialogueController](../Controllers/README.md#dialoguecontroller).
