# Assets: Game - Checks

Any game, and especially RPGs, require that a player's character interact with the world around them.  

'Check' prefabs serve to enable this functionality in Frankie.  These are game objects that can be attached/childed to any other game objects in the world to enable sed interaction.  

All 'checks' thus include:
* A) a trigger-based 2D collider
* B) a 'check' component derived from the [CheckBase](../../Scripts/CheckInteractions/CheckBase.cs) abstract class

, with additional levels of varying complexity to allow for specific interactions -- e.g. with messages, with further user input, toggling as a function of predicates, with more numerous options/outcomes, etc.

## Standard Checks

The standard check configurables are shown below:

Notably, standard checks are brokebn into three different check types.

* **Simple** - with prefab [Check](./Check.prefab)
  * Allowing for triggering arbitrary Unity Event(s) w/ player interaction
    * as linked on the component, shown in the list under `Check Interaction (PlayerStateMachine)`
    * note: this UnityEvent passes the player state machine as a parameter to allow for more complex interactions
* **Message** - with prefab [CheckWithMessage](./CheckWithMessage.prefab)
  * Allowing for the same, while also prompting a UI dialogue/text box to appear with a defined message
  * For this option, `{0}` can be used to use the party leader's name
  * The check interaction will, by default, trigger after the UI dialogue/text box is closed
    * the `Check At Start of Interaction` parameter can be set true to instead trigger the Unity Event(s) before the UI text/dialogue box is prompted
* **ChoiceConfirmation** - with prefab [CheckWithConfirmationComponent](./CheckWithConfirmationComponent.prefab)
  * Allowing for the same, while instead prompting a UI dialogue/text box with a yes/no confirmation option
  * For this option, independent message text & Unity Event(s) can be defined for either:
    * accepting - via `Check Interaction (PlayerStateMachine)` list
    * rejecting - via `Reject Interaction (PlayerStateMachine)` list

Example checks can be found in:
* [FrankieHomeDesk](../WorldObjects/SavePoints/FrankieHomeDesk.prefab): Used to trigger a [WorldSaver](../../Scripts/World/WorldSaver.cs) Save() call
* [WaterCooler](../WorldObjects/Office/WaterCooler_0.prefab): Used to trigger a [WorldPointAdjuster](../../Scripts/World/WorldPointAdjuster.cs) to heal the party & restore AP
* [InfoSign](../WorldObjects/Generic/Signs/InfoSign.prefab): Used to prompt a UI message with th (arbitrary) sign content
* [CoinMachine](../WorldObjects/VendingMachines/CoinMachine.prefab): Used to trigger a [WorldCashGiverTaker](../../Scripts/World/WorldCashGiverTaker.cs) to give add cash to the player's wallet
* and so onâ€¦

## Complex Checks

Beyond the straightforward checks noted above, there are a number of relatively common checks with higher levels of complexity that need to be supported for a standard RPG.  For these more common checks, generic implementations and prefabs (also derived from the [CheckBase](../../Scripts/CheckInteractions/CheckBase.cs)  abstract class) are detailed below.

### Check With Predicate Evaluation

### Check to Unlock Enable

### Check with Configuration

### Check with Dynamic Options
